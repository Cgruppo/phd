## Overview

 * Value in visualizing many data sets together
 * Difficult to realize due to heterogeneity of:
   * formats, protocols, level of detail, identifiers
 * Possible to model most data sets as data cubes
 * Contribution: "Universal Data Cube" framework
   * novel data structures and algorithms
   * facilitates data cube integration, visualization
